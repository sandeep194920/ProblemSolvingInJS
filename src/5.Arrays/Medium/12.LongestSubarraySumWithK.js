// *Approach 1 - Brute-force - O(N^3)

/*
- We need to find all subarrays, and pick the max length out of it.
- Finding subarrays as follows:
   j
   2,3,5,1,9
   i
- Initally, i and j points to same thing. We get subarray of first element. 
- Then j moves to right and we get subarray of i till j like this
     j
   2,3,5,1,9
   i
- Then j moves further and we get subarray of i till j, and so on
       j
   2,3,5,1,9
   i

So the idea is to iterate from i till j everytime. The i runs from 0 to arr length. And j starts
everytime from i and moves 1 by 1 till end. For example, once j moves till end, then i is incremented
and j starts from i like this

         j
   2,3,5,1,9
   i
   k
k is used as inner most loop for running from i to j

sum = 0 -> 2 -> 2 -> 5 -> 0 -> 2 -> 5 -> 10

/*
Similar to above approach but not using k here. The difference between this and above approach
- In the above approach, as j moves every element, the distance between i and j increased by 1. We use k to traverse that and find sum.
- In this appraoch, as j moves every element, we calculate sum using j and check if sum is equal to target. 
We don't recompute sum (using k) from the beginning for every j move as we do above

// *Approach 3 (Optimal time - Hashing) - Prefix Sum - O(N)
// * This is the optimal possible approach for negative numbers as well. For negative numbers, the approach 4 doesn't work

/*
Here's the idea. This prefix sum approach would help you solve many problems:

- Look at index 4. From index 3 to 4, the sum is 10 which is targetSum. Note: No other elements add up to 10 here (slighly changed input compared to previous examples)

Index   0  1  2  3  4
        2, 3, 6, 1, 9

- We realize that the sum from 3 to 4 is 10 = targetSum only when we reach 4 and subtract
ALL ELEMENTS' SUM from 0 to 2. But the questions are:

 - How do we know that we need to consider we have to subtract all elements from 0 to 2 and add only index 3 and 4 only to get targetSum
 
              ðŸ‘‡    ðŸ‘‡
Index   0  1  2  3  4
        2, 3, 6, 1, 9

 - For this we use prefix sum. Meaning we need to add sum of previous elements to current element at 
 every index. 


Index         0  1  2  3  4

arr           2, 3, 6, 1, 9

Sum at        2  5 11 12 21
every index        

* - Now, let's say we are at index 4 as we did in step 2. The sum here is 21, and we subtract 10 which is target sum,
* we get 11 which is at index 2. Then we check if this 11 is present as sum of all elements at any point (in hashmap), and
* if yes, that means the current index - 11th index gives us the maxLength of elements

* Also, another thing to consider is, let's say if targetSum is 11. We get it in first 3 elements only. So at any point, 
* if sum adds up to targetSum straight away, we need to also calculate maxLength there

? SUMMARY OF PREFIX SUM

- Loop from beginning, and while traversing, do these:
 - Sum the elements with previous ones
   - Everytime, check if currentSum === targetSum. If yes then that would be the candidate for maxLen calculation
   - Everytime check if currentSum - targetSum result exists in hashmap
     - If yes, then it will be a candidate for maxLen calculation
   - Add currentSum as key and index as value in any case to hashmap

?Prefix Sum - The overall idea is to use a hashmap to store all previous sums at any index
?and store that sum(key) and index(value) in the hashmap, and use that to figure of maxLen
